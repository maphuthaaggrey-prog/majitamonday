     questionOne: "Photography Journey",
     answerOne: "My journey began back in 2013, I remember I had just bought myself a smart phone that I wouldn’t mention its exact name, I started exploring photography making use of that phone device. I’d shoot pictures and they would appear as if I was using a digital camera. This was only a passion until I realised that I should actually turn in a full time career, that’s when I started to enrol at Tshwane University of Technology under the faculty of arts. That’s where I got my qualification in advanced photography, a period of 4 years studying a picture.",
     questionTwo: "How did you know this was for you",
     answerTwo: "I knew this was for me when everytime we went out with friends and family, I was always the only taking them pictures, I’m never on the pictures with them but behind the camera, even though I was using a cellphone but I was taking very good pictures that no one could ever think of.",
     questionThree: "Which lens do you use most often, and why?",
     answerThree: "I think every professional photographer would attest to this that a 50mm lens is a must have, you can’t go without it. The depth of field is incredible, I’m talking aperture of f1.8 giving you a minimal focus to the subject and more light into the frame.",
     questionFour: "How do you capture great photos in low-light or tricky lighting?",
     answerFour: "Always balance your f-stop with your shutter speed, and your ISO should never exceed 400, actually try to keep it at 100, that’s what reduces grain or noise in the photograph. Remember ISO deals with the noise, while f-stop deal with the amount of light that goes on the lens and shutter speed deals with the speed you’d want the picture to be captured at.",

They supported it from the start and they are looking for the 2nd one which will take place in the following year."] },
     { question: "Common mistakes beginner photographers make, and how can they avoid them?", answer: ["Most beginners are arrogant, they don't wanna learn. They literally wanna run before they could even crawl or walk. Another mistake they make is to start making their service known to the public without fully knowing the technical requirements of photography. Some don't even know the basic needs of photography. I wanna tell you that being a professional photographer has nothing to do with taking a picture. Taking a picture is probably 2 percent of being a photographer, the remaining 98 percent is what beginners avoid, which is being a professional."] },
     { question: "Is formal education or hands-on experience more important in photography?", answer: ["Education is very important, don't even be told otherwise, I also thought I knew photography until I went to school, that's when I realized that I know nothing. School will sharpen your mind, be it photography or anything else. You can be an experienced photographer but lacking professionalism. I see most beginners are doing it. They lack such professionalism and discipline."] },
     { question: "Future plans", answer: ["My future plans is to teach photography, well I'm already doing it, but I wanna do it on a professional level. There are people that I've mentored and still mentoring some at the moment, also to build a first ever photography studio in my community."] }

The clothing journey began when I started drawing logos even though I knew I was not that good with drawing, so there this dude in my class who was great with drawing and he took my sketches and re-drew them and they came out how I envisioned them and basically that's where I discovered my Creative Directing skills and from there I went to creative direct a lot of stuff from logos to clothing and event production (banners to stage arrangements etc) and from clothing I went to events, the events journey started when me and my team had an idea to launch our brand and for that to be possible we had to host a launch event and it became a success, it being a success opened more doors to host other events and now we are here.",

Without them honestly I don't think I would be as great as I am right now as a creative and they bring out the best in me so yea Food Garden best respresents me as a creative looking at how far we came from just us using pallets and black chairs to upgrading to umbrellas and benches. I honestly wouldn't want to indulge more into this because I might spill a few secrets or rather what is coming but the vision is clear everyone can see where the event is heading and the creativity of setting up the event comes from the people, it comes from how I envision the people would like to sit around you know ?

I used to watch legendary 1060 producers, like Divinzo and Master V, making house music at my mom's house when I was just a kid. That's how I got started becoming a music producer and making house music too. Later, in 2015 (those Juice Back and Roll Up times), I transitioned from making house music to creating hip-hop beats, influenced by my brother, Notorioux, who I used to watch making hip-hop beats all the time.",
        questionThree: "Where do you get your inspiration for your beat and melodies?",
        answerThree: "I find inspiration for my beats and melodies by listening to songs, from old school classics to new releases.

My other favourite part is the creative process - engaging with producers to find dope beats, having studio sessions, smoke sessions, writing on beats, having listening sessions, and definitely the performance part. I've always been one with Hip Hop, and having the ability to create my own songs from scratch (with the help of other pivotal members of the crew) is definitely a blessing from above, so basically my favourite part about being a musician is simply doing it (what musicians do - make music).

One thing about me is that I'm an opportunist when it comes to success, so whenever I see something that can change my life for the better, I check myself if I can do it, then if I can we then execute.

Bringing fashion and Art together, Is something that i believed its gonna unite our society together.",
        questionTwo: "What sparked your interest in art and made you want pursue it?",
        answerTwo: "I was born and raised around a brother (family friend) who loved art so much it wore off unto me. At grade 4 i was already certain i had to do art in my life from seeing some of the artists that i knew that time of the Picasso's painting. But that time i was never getting much information about art because of not being exposed to internet, grade 10 i saw my first Francis Bacon painting and thought to myself 'im going pursue art as a career instead of a hobby",
        questionThree: "Where do you find inspiration for your art?",
        answerThree: "I find inspiration from our fallen african kingdoms and are current state of society. When i can't form new ideas i travel home and analyse how much everything shifted from then to now, how its caused use to struggle or win, then take that and form a new mental image of all the damages and build ups of the human society as whole.",
        questionFour: "What do you see as the biggest challenges facing artists today?",
        answerFour: "There's many challenge we face as artist, for example exposure and job opportunities, like as an artist there are some of the things you have to do them free because you want exposure which you can spend about 5 years doing things free. and also art equipment is not cheap and not easily accessible, art stores are very rare. So basically as an artist one of the difficulty thing is you can't full express yourself if you not financially ok, you'll always have to compromise, which is something that it's not full quraantee. today theres alot of people creating art, which makes it a bit harder to break through if you creating something someone has already seen on a platform where people just like an scroll past. Also people gate keeping art events and call outs to galleries, we could work together and make southie art infested that way more culture can be expressed through the expansion of artist in thesespaces.",

        questionOne: "What motivated you to start your own barbershop?",
        answerOne: "My barbershop adventure started in high school, I think the main aim of starting it was because I wanted to earn some extra money. At first, it was tough getting customers, and I wasn't super motivated because of various reasons, But when people started taking a liking to my work and saying nice things about it, it made me feel good. I realized that I had a talent that could make people happy and look good. And when people from other kasi's came to my barbershop, it showed me that my skills were reaching far and wide. With more and more people coming in, I decided to grow my business. Each new customer boosted my confidence and made me want to work even harder. Looking back now, I'm thankful for the journey and all the lessons learned. My barbershop isn't just a place to get a haircut - it's a reminder of how believing in yourself and your talents can lead you to something great.",
        questionTwo: "How did you go about turning your passion for barbering into a business?",
        answerTwo: "Well, When I was a kid I was always into finding ways to make money. Back in primary school I started by selling mangoes, and naartjies(dinarekisi) from my Aunt's garden. Then later on I got into fixing bikes, and funny enough, people even started to call me 'Mr. Fix'. And That's when I realized I actually enjoy running my own show. And now, here I am, with my very own barber Salon.",
        questionThree: "What were some of the challenges you faced when starting your barbershop, and how did you overcome them?",
        answerThree: "The challenges I've faced have been tough. People would often say I was too young for the job, doubting my skills and ability to cut hair properly. Some even thought I'd mess up their hair completely. And I don't blame them because back then, I didn't have all the right equipment, and my workspace wasn't exactly ideal. But despite all that, my determination kept me going. For every negative comment, there were also positive ones that encouraged me to push harder and do better. They're the ones that gave me the energy to build something bigger and better out of this passion.",
        questionFour: "What advice would you give to someone thinking about starting their own barbershop?",
        answerFour: "Building a successful barbershop takes time and effort. Stay committed to your vision, even when faced with challenges or setbacks, keep pushing forward. And you'll eventual see results. Believe in Yourself, Don't let doubts hold you back. Trust in your skills and passion for barbering, even if others doubt you because of your age or experience. Start Small, Dream Big, Begin with what you have and expand from that. You don't nee fancy equipment or a perfect workspace to start. Just focus on providing excellent service and building a loyal clientele. And always remember, both positive and negative feedbacks can be valuable. Use criticism as motivation to improve.",
